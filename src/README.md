# PGraphInCS
A flexible implementation of P-Graph algorithms in C#.

Current release version: 1.0.0

## Description

The aim of the library is to provide the code-base for quick and flexible implementation of P-graph algorithms, while maintaining acceptable performance. The library contains implementations of the main algorithms of the P-graph framework, i.e., MSG, SSG, and ABB. It provides several configurable base classes and implementations of branch-and-bound algorithms. This allows new algorithms to be developed both for the existing and for extended problems. When creating new algorithms, only the new logic has to be implemented, while the unchanged parts can be used directly from this library. Also contains compatibility with the main problems supported by P-Graph Studio.

## Examples and tutorials

The Github page of the project (https://github.com/akosorosz/PGraphInCS) contains contains sample projects that serve as tutorials. The samples each discuss certain parts and functionalities of the library.
